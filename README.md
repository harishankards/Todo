# react-todo

This is just a simple React.js todo app. It's made using react.js and localStorage API.
I've added some random Anonymous quotes for no reason and that Anonymous is me maybe.

In case you still wanna see the demo of this so called app, here you go:
```
git clone "https://github.com/harishankards/react-todo"
cd react-todo/
npm start
```

Now go check here: `localost:3000`

### Thanks
